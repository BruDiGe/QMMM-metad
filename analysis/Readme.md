# QMMM Metadynamics Analysis: Statistical Evaluation Along MEPSA Pathways

This repository provides a Python script (`qmmm-analysis.py`) to perform statistical analysis of collective variables (CVs) from metadynamics simulations. The analysis projects simulation data onto a minimum free energy pathway (MFEP) and computes mean and standard deviation values of relevant descriptors along this path.

##  Input Files:

### 1. `path.dat`
This file contains the MFEP, generated by MEPSA based on a 2D Free Energy Surface (FES) produced from metadynamics. 
### 2. `data.dat`
This file contains the raw trajectory data of collective variables (COLVAR files) generated from PLUMED
